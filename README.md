# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This webpage holds a Dynamic JavaScript quiz. The user has 60 seconds to answer fundamental JavaScript questions and is scored based on the speed of completion. It features a HighScore List stored locally, allowing users to compete to beat their high scores.

## Known Bugs
This project currently has issues with the countdown clock not displaying as intended though it continues to count down in the background. 

I temporarily removed the HighScore system from the Main Branch. The current way I implemented it broke the site, and I deleted it to restart it from scratch. I hope to have it fixed and uploaded to the main branch.

## Project status
This project is considered a work in progress.
